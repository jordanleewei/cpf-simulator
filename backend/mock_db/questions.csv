1,Medium,S-20240061587,"Dear Officers,
I would like to appeal to withdraw from my Retirement account about $5000. I am aware that if I withdraw my monthly payout will be much lesser. Please kindly assist me on my appeal soonest possible.","Dear <member name>
We refer to your appeal of 6 February 2024 to withdraw a lump sum from your Retirement Account (RA).
The primary objective of setting aside CPF savings in the RA is to provide members with a regular income in their retirement years. With the aging population and longer life expectancy, CPF savings must be carefully managed to see members through a longer retirement period. 
Based on your current RA balance, we are unable to accede to your request to withdraw from your RA. Withdrawing a lump sum from the RA would deplete your RA savings prematurely, which affects the amount of funds you have for later years.
You will continue to receive your monthly payouts till your RA balances are depleted.",Appeal to withdraw CPF
2,Medium,S-20240061939,"I am appealing to you to let me withdraw some of my funds from special and ordinary account. My wife and I both have not been working and have no income to live off of, and I require funds for daily expenses. If you could let me withdraw a small amount of my funds, I would be most grateful.","Dear <member name>

We refer to your request of 6 February 2024 to withdraw a lump sum from your Ordinary and Special Accounts for your daily expenses.

CPF members aged 55 and above can withdraw the excess savings in the Ordinary and Special Accounts (OA and SA) after setting aside their Full Retirement Sum (FRS).

Members who have a shortfall in the Retirement Account (RA) to meet the retirement sum could still withdraw the first $5,000 from their CPF. For subsequent withdrawal, a portion or all of their OA and SA savings would be transferred to the RA to meet the retirement sum shortfall. The transfer is made so that there will be more monies in the RA for retirement payouts. Any balance would then be paid to them.

Our records show that you had withdrawn your first $5,000 from your CPF accounts in January 2019.

As you have a retirement sum shortfall to meet your Full Retirement Sum (FRS) of $176,000, when you apply for a subsequent withdrawal, a portion of your OA and SA savings would be transferred to your RA to help set aside your retirement sum. The balance is then paid to you. Your current withdrawable amount is estimated to be $0.49. This amount is shown in your Retirement Dashboard under the ‘Withdraw for immediate retirement needs’ tab.

We are unable to increase the withdrawal amount, as it would deplete your savings prematurely.

Additional Assistance

only after BRS is locked-in then the balance returned back to OA/SA?
2. Assuming the above will any remaining amount in my SA is allowed to be withdrawn either in lump sum or at any
time in the future?
3. At what stage do I need to inform CPF of pledging my property and selecting BRS for CPF Life?","Dear <member name>
We refer to your email of 13 February 2024.
You asked the following:
1. So if I pledge my property then only the BRS will be transferred to the RA? Or will the FRS be transferred first and only after BRS is
locked-in then the balance returned back to OA/SA?
No. As shared, the FRS will be automatically set aside in the RA first.
Thereafter, if you own a property in Singapore with remaining lease that lasts them until you are 95 or older, you can apply to set aside
the BRS in the RA.
When you apply to set aside the BRS in the RA with your property, the excess savings above the BRS (exclude interest earned, any
government grants received and top-ups made under the Retirement Sum Topping-Up (RSTU) Scheme) will be paid to you in cash.
These excess savings will not be transferred to the OA or SA.

2. Assuming the above will any remaining amount in my SA is allowed to be withdrawn either in lump sum or at any time in the
future?
As long as you have set aside the BRS or FRS in the RA, you would be able to withdraw any remaining OA and SA savings.
You can withdraw them partially or fully at any time in future.

3. At what stage do I need to inform CPF of pledging my property and selecting BRS for CPF Life?
If you would like to set aside the BRS and withdraw the RA savings (excluding interest earned, any government grants received and topups made under the Retirement Sum Topping-up Scheme) above the BRS using your property, you may wish to do so before starting your CPF LIFE payouts (between age 65 and 70).
Once your payouts start, all your RA savings (depends on which plan) may be deducted for your CPF LIFE premium. Once deducted, these
monies will then be “locked” for your payouts and cannot be withdrawn in a lumpsum.
At your convenience, you can complete this online application form (any time from age 55) to set aside the BRS and apply for withdrawal using your property",Enqury about BRS withdrawal

1. If I opt for BRS and the standard plan will my remaining OA and SA balances remain in CPF earning interest till whenever I choose to withdraw even past 80yo?

2. Once the BRS has been transferred to RA will I be allowed to top-up the SA balance back to its maximum allowed that year?","Dear <member name>
Thank you for writing to us on 6 February 2024.
You asked:
1. If I opt for BRS and the standard plan will my remaining OA and SA balances remain in CPF earning interest till whenever I choose to
withdraw even past 80yo?
You are only required to join and choose your CPF LIFE plan at the age that you want to start your payouts; between age 65 and 70.
We would like to clarify that the Full Retirement Sum (FRS) will still be set aside in the RA when you turn 55. You can withdraw your
remaining OA and SA savings at any time, after setting aside the FRS in your RA.
If you do not have an immediate need, you can leave the savings in the CPF accounts as rainy day funds while earning the prevailing
interest rates. You can withdraw them at any time, only when you need to (even after age 80). There is no age limit for the withdrawal
from the OA and SA.
After the FRS is set aside, if you own a property in Singapore with remaining lease that lasts them until you are 95 or older, you can
choose to set aside the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) and apply to withdraw part of your RA savings in cash down to your BRS using your
property. The withdrawable amounts in RA will exclude interest earned, any government grants received and top-ups made under the
Retirement Sum Topping-Up (RSTU) Scheme.

2. Once the BRS has been transferred to RA will I be allowed to top-up the SA balance back to its maximum allowed that year?
No. Top ups to the SA is only applicable for recipients below age 55.

Is CPF LIFE like an annuity plan?
=> A BRS/FRS/EHS lump sum transfer from OA & SA into RA at age 55. And in the next 10 years, it will generate compound interest. At age 65, citizen can decide to start the annuity plan with monthly withdrawal credited to a bank account assign.

Based on this year FRS & CPF LIFE Estimator...
=> Female, born in 1969, RA $205,800
=> ""At age 65, I would like to join CPF LIFE with $305,000"" ($99,200 of compound interest for 10 yrs)
=> Based on standard plan, estimated payout is $1,540 per month.
=> Say by age 85, I would have withdraw $1540*12*20 = $369,600
=> $369,600 - $305,000 = $64,600 is the compound interest earn from the balance in the RA or CPF LIFE from age 65 to age 85.

Question:
1) What is the difference between RA & CPF LIFE account?
2) How does the annuity plan works? Eg the annual withdrawal amount is transfer from RA to CPF LIFE (payout for 12 months) with the rest left in RA to earn compound interest?
3) Say 1st yr...$1,540*12 = $18,480 transfer to CPF LIFE with $286,520 left in RA for compound interest?
4) There isn't much explanation online how RA & CPF LIFE works. As such, there are friends who had started withdrawing their CPF LIFE providing a different way a normal annuity plan works.
5) Text from friend... ""Like last year when John got his payout in May, they will take out all his money from RA but leave behind his interest from Jan to Apr 2023. They will not wipe out his interest. So when er called CPF the officer told us that this interest amount in RA will still earn interest and until a certain years when CPF think they want to increase the payout they will take out this interest & add on to the payout.""
6) the sentence above doesn't make sense for $64,600 interest as tabulated above.
7) Say 5% int of RA of $305,000 = $1525 left in RA for compound int. This amount will work out to be only $91.50 (6% of $1525) for 1st yr. There is no way it can reach $64,600 as tabulated above after 20 yrs.

In a normal annuity plan, each year the balance principal & compound interest (age 55 to 65) continue to generate compound interest until all is drawn upon. Correct me if I am wrong.

Kindly explain to make me & my friends understand better.","Dear <member name>
We refer to your enquiries 22 January 2024. Thank you for your patience.
CPF LIFE is a longevity insurance annuity scheme that provides members with a monthly payout for as long as they live.
We understand that you have used our CPF LIFE Estimator to estimate the monthly payout based on a female, born in 1969. If this member chose to join CPF LIFE Standard Plan and start her monthly payout at age 65, all her Retirement Account (RA) savings (estimated $305,000) will be used as CPF LIFE premium.
It is not an annual transfer of payout monies for the year to the CPF LIFE premium.
If the member chooses to start her monthly payout later, for example she can join CPF LIFE Standard Plan and start
her payout at age 68. All her existing RA savings at that point in time, will be used as CPF LIFE premium. When you
adjust the first slider bar in the CPF LIFE Estimator to age 68, you will be able to see the projected RA balance
($345,000) at age 68 in the second slider.
When a member who is receiving her CPF LIFE monthly payout, receives RA inflows (for example from interest earned or top-ups), the inflows may be automatically used to increase her CPF LIFE premium, so that she will receive higher CPF LIFE monthly payouts for life.

CPF LIFE premium will continue to earn the interest rate floor of 4% per annum, as well as extra interest of up to 2%
per annum on the first $60,000 of the member’s combined CPF balances.

The interest earned on the member’s CPF LIFE premium benefits her in two ways:
1. It is factored into her monthly payouts and she receives a higher payout from the start.
The interest accumulated on her CPF LIFE premium, along with the premiums of other CPF LIFE members,
ensures that she can continue receiving payouts no matter how long she lives, even if her CPF LIFE premium
balance is depleted.
