Why is interest earned on my CPF LIFE premium not included as part of the amount paid to my beneficiaries when I pass away?,"['CPF LIFE is a longevity insurance scheme that provides you with a monthly payout for as long as you live. When you join CPF LIFE, your CPF LIFE premium will be paid with your CPF savings. Projected interest earned on your CPF LIFE premium is factored into your monthly payouts from the start.
Your CPF LIFE payouts will be drawn from your CPF LIFE premium first. When your CPF LIFE premium is exhausted, you will then draw your monthly payouts for as long as you live from the interest that you and other CPF LIFE members have accumulated.
The lifelong payouts under CPF LIFE for all members are made possible through this method of interest accumulation. That is why interest does not form part of the amount paid to the beneficiaries of CPF LIFE members when they pass away.
If you pass on before your CPF LIFE premium is exhausted, the CPF LIFE premium balance (if any) together with any remaining CPF savings will be distributed to your loved ones.']",https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/infohub/cpf-clarifies/policy-faqs/why-interest-earned-on-cpf-life-premium-not-paid-to-beneficiaries

How do CPF interest rates compare with other countries' pension systems?,"['CPF interest rates are fair and attractive.
Your CPF savings earn up to 3.5% per year in the Ordinary Account and up to 5% per year in the Special, MediSave and Retirement Accounts on the first $60,000 of combined CPF balances. Members aged 55 and above get an extra 1% on the first $30,000 of their combined CPF balances (i.e. up to 6% per year). You do not bear any investment risk on your CPF savings.
In comparison, citizens in some other countries have to choose their own pension investment plan and expose their retirement savings to market risks. Their retirement nest egg could be affected during a financial crisis or sustained period of low interest rates.
Nevertheless, if you are a financially-savvy member who wishes to invest your CPF savings for higher returns and are willing to bear the investment risk, you may do so through the CPF Investment Scheme.']",https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/infohub/cpf-clarifies/policy-faqs/how-do-cpf-interest-rates-compare-with-other-pension-systems
Why am I not allowed to withdraw my CPF savings in a lump sum if I have savings above the prevailing Full Retirement Sum before turning age 55?,"['The CPF system is designed to help all Singaporeans save for retirement. The more you set aside in your CPF for retirement, the higher your monthly CPF payout which you can enjoy starting from your Payout Eligibility Age.
As your personal circumstances, including the means to support yourself financially in retirement besides your CPF savings, could change, it would not be prudent to make significant lump sum CPF withdrawals too far in advance of your retirement.

Why do I need CPF LIFE?,"['Nobody can predict how long anyone will actually live. Therefore, planning how much of your retirement savings to use for living expenses is a dilemma √¢¬Ä¬ì Spend too much and you might not have enough if you live longer than you thought; spend too little and you might deprive yourself from fully enjoying your hard-earned savings.
With increasing advances in technology and healthcare, you are likely to live longer than your grandparents√¢¬Ä¬ô or parents√¢¬Ä¬ô generation. Therefore, you cannot predict how long you will live by looking at how long your parents or grandparents live. Otherwise, you may underestimate your lifespan and find your savings depleted with many more years to live when you are no longer able to work.
With CPF LIFE, you do not need to worry about being caught in such a situation but have the assurance of having a steady stream of income, no matter what age you live to.']",https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/retirement-income/monthly-payouts/why-do-i-need-cpf-life-

How does the CPF LIFE Escalating Plan work?,"['The CPF LIFE Escalating Plan is a suitable option if you want to protect your retirement income from rising prices. Under this plan you'll receive payouts that increase by 2% each year. Although the payouts start lower, they will eventually become higher than the Standard Plan and Basic Plan payouts. The Escalating Plan gives you peace of mind knowing that you can generally maintain your standard of living even as the cost of living goes up during your retirement years.
For example, if you start with a monthly payout of $1,000 when you turn 65, it will increase by 2% each year and reach around $1,500 when you are 85. The 2% increase takes place every year in the same month that you receive your first payout.
Under this plan, all your Retirement Account savings will be deducted as CPF LIFE premium when you join CPF LIFE, which can be anytime from 65 to 70.
Your CPF LIFE monthly payouts will first be paid from your CPF LIFE premium. When your CPF LIFE premium is depleted, you will continue to receive the monthly payouts from the interest that you and other CPF LIFE members have accumulated, no matter how long you live.']",https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/retirement-income/monthly-payouts/how-does-the-cpf-life-escalating-plan-work-
Why is the increase in CPF LIFE Escalating Plan payouts fixed at 2% per year and not matched to actual inflation rate?,"['CPF LIFE Escalating Plan payouts are not specifically matched to actual inflation in each year so that the increase in payouts is predictable and stable.
By fixing the increase at 2% per year, CPF LIFE can provide some protection against inflation while keeping premiums at a more affordable level.

Why are the retirement sums increasing yearly?,"['The increase in retirement sums is due to the following:
1. **Increase in cost of living** As prices of goods and services rise over time, we will need to save more for retirement to ensure that our savings will still be sufficient to cover higher expenses in the future.
2. **Increase in life expectancy** As people are living longer, we will need more savings to last throughout our retirement.
3. **Increase in standard of living** As incomes increase over time, our basic retirement expectations and expenses will also naturally increase. Setting aside more savings allows us to receive higher monthly payouts to afford higher retirement expenses in future.

It's important to keep in mind that the amount needed for retirement has increased over the years. For example, if the Full Retirement Sum had remained unchanged from $30,000 when it was first introduced in 1987 (previously known as the Minimum Sum), it would only provide a monthly payout of about $300 today. This amount would not be enough to cover daily living expenses and rent.

Why should I top up my retirement savings?,"['There are several reasons why you should consider topping up your retirement savings:
**1. Higher monthly payouts in retirement**
By topping up your Special Account (SA) (if you are below 55) or Retirement Account (RA) (if you are 55 or above), you are growing your retirement savings and will enjoy [higher monthly payouts](/member/faq/growing-your-savings/retirement-sum-topping-up-scheme/how-will-the-top-ups-to-my-retirement-savings-be-used-) when you retire.
**2. Risk-free interest rates\* of up to 6% per annum**
By topping up your SA or RA, you can earn risk-free [interest rates\* of up to 6% per annum](/member/growing-your-savings/earning-higher-returns/earning-attractive-interest) on your savings.
For instance, if you save $100 a month for 15 years on your own, you would have saved $18,000. On the other hand, if you top up $100 a month to your SA or RA for the same amount of time, you would have saved over $24,000\*. If you continue to top up for another 10 years, your savings would grow even more, reaching over $50,000\* with compound interest.
**3. Enjoy tax relief and matching grant for cash top-ups**
By topping up with cash, you can also benefit from:
* [Tax relief of up to $16,000](/member/faq/growing-your-savings/retirement-sum-topping-up-scheme/can-i-claim-tax-reliefs-when-i-make-a-cash-top-up-to-my-my-loved).√Ç¬†[Terms and conditions apply](/member/faq/growing-your-savings/retirement-sum-topping-up-scheme/what-are-the-conditions-for-me-to-enjoy-tax-relief-).

What is risk-return tradeoff?,"['All investments are subject to risk.

Historically, lower-risk investments √¢¬Ä¬î like cash equivalent (e.g., fixed deposit) investments √¢¬Ä¬î have typically offered lower potential for long-term growth and investment return. Higher-risk investments √¢¬Ä¬î like stock investments √¢¬Ä¬î have typically offered greater potential for long-term growth and investment return.

Should I maintain a consistent strategy in investing?,"['Once you have decided on the right investment mix to meet your investment objectives and goals, you should try to maintain a consistent strategy.

If you try to ""time the market"" you run the risk of getting caught in the trap of ""buying high"" and ""selling low."" If you hold on to your investment, chances are good that its value may eventually go back up, and that it may end up being worth more than when its value dropped.

These underlying ILP sub-funds are similar to unit trusts. The allocation of premiums across these sub-funds may be fixed by the insurer or decided by the policyholder, depending on the structure of the ILP. The advantage of an ILP is that it effectively combines investments in a unit trust with purchase of insurance coverage. This is also its disadvantage.

While this screening mechanism has helped to ensure a minimum standard for the funds under the CPFIS, more stringent criteria have been introduced so that funds under the CPFIS would better meet the objectives of CPFIS, which is to help members invest for the long-term for financial security in old age. In addition to setting a higher evaluation benchmark based on the current screening mechanism, the Board will also consider the funds' expense ratio.

What is Equity Risk?
Equity Risk is related to exposure to the ""riskier"" types of investments in the Funds. The greater the proportion of assets invested in stocks, the higher the Equity Risk (i.e. higher risk category). Conversely, the greater the proportion of investments in bonds and cash, the lower the Equity Risk (i.e. lower risk category).
What is Focus Risk?
Focus Risk reflects how focused the investments of the Funds are in particular geographical regions, foreign countries, foreign currencies, industries or individual companies. A Fund that invests in shares of companies from around the world would have lower Focus Risk (i.e. broadly diversified) than a fund that invests in shares of companies from one country only (i.e. narrowly diversified).']",https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/growing-your-savings/cpf-investment-schemes/what-is-the-cpf-investment-scheme-risk-classification-system
What is an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF)?,"['Under the CPF Investment Scheme, you can invest in Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).
An ETF is an investment fund that is listed and traded on an Exchange. It is designed to track an index of markets and sectors or a fixed basket of stocks. It is bought and sold in the same way stocks are bought and sold on the Exchange.
Investors can track the ETF's performance by monitoring the particular underlying index's performance.
What are the benefits of an ETF?
Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) offer investors the benefit of diversification as investors need only to buy an ETF share to gain exposure to a diversified portfolio of domestic or international stocks. ETFs have low annual management fees and investors may buy or sell ETFs at prevailing market prices during trading hours in the Exchange. Investors are also able to see what stocks they are buying as ETFs offer transparency in its composition.']",https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/growing-your-savings/cpf-investment-schemes/what-is-an-exchange-traded-fund
When should I invest in broadly diversified investments and when should I invest in narrowly focused investments?,"['After you have made your decision on how much to invest in the three basic types of investments: cash, bonds and stocks (i.e. based on the amount of equity risk you are comfortable with), for most CPF members, investing in broadly diversified investments within that equity risk category should generally help minimise investment risk. In other words, investing in broadly diversified investments should help reduce risk compared with investing in narrowly focused investments in the same equity risk category.
However, there could also be reasons for investing in narrowly focused investments:

You enjoy riskier investments, even when the odds are not necessarily in your favour. You are happy to take on the extra downside risk of not diversifying because of the potential for higher returns, although you are aware that a positive result is not guaranteed.
For investments in the same equity risk category, it is reasonable to expect potential rewards over the long term to be very roughly the same for both a broadly diversified investment and a narrowly focused investment. However, you may want to accept the higher downside risk of a narrowly focused investment if you think that a narrowly focused investment may give better results in the short term.
For example, if you are confident about the recovery of the Japanese economy in the short term, you may wish to invest in a Japan focused unit trust even though this unit trust has higher risk than a better diversified global equity unit trust.']",https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/growing-your-savings/cpf-investment-schemes/when-should-i-invest-in-broadly-diversified-investments
What are the basic investment classes?,"['Most investments fall into one of three basic asset classes √¢¬Ä¬î cash equivalents, bonds and stocks (also called shares or equities).
To read more about these three basic asset classes, please select:
Cash equivalents
Cash equivalent (e.g. fixed deposit) investments are usually investments which have low risk of losing value but offer relatively low potential returns. Cash equivalents are typically used to hold money that will be needed in the near future or to hold assets temporarily while considering how to invest the assets for the long term.
Bonds
Bonds, often referred to as fixed income securities or debt securities, are loans to a corporation or government to finance its operations. A bond represents the corporation's or government's promise to repay at a specified date (at maturity) the amount borrowed from investors. The bond generally earns interest. Bonds also increase or decrease in value based on market conditions.
Examples of bonds include government bonds and corporate bonds.
Stocks
Stocks represent ownership in a corporation. If you own stock in the XYZ Corporation, you are part owner of that company. Stocks may provide income in the form of dividends. Stock investments increase in value when the price of the share goes up and vice versa. Historically, over periods of several years or more, many types of stocks have increased in value. However, past performance is no guarantee of future results.']",https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/growing-your-savings/cpf-investment-schemes/what-are-the-basic-investment-classes

3. The gold ETF is listed on the SGX; and
4. The company allows Agent Banks to appoint all CPF unitholders of the gold ETF as proxies to attend and vote at meetings.

2. Must provide CPF Board a copy of the representative agreement evidencing the appointment of the representative by the foreign gold ETF issuer or marketing agent;
3.

"If I run out of CPF monies to pay the premiums of my Academic Staff Provident Fund Approved Investment Scheme (ASPFAIS) Part V insurance policies, what should I do?","['You have the following options:
1. Use cash to pay the premiums;
2. Convert your Part V insurance policies to a paid-up mode1; or
3. Activate the Automatic Premium Loan (APL)2 or Extended Term Insurance (ETI)3 feature(s) of your Part V insurance policies, if they have such features and if your insurance company allows you to do so.
1Converting a policy to paid-up mode means that the policyholder will not need to pay premiums anymore. The sum assured of a paid-up policy is usually lower than that of the original policy. All supplementary riders attached will be terminated.
2APL means that once the policy has accumulated sufficient cash value, if the policyholder is unable to pay the premium, he can borrow from the cash value. However, he is required to pay back the loan and compound interest. Once the loan plus compound interest exceeds the cash value of the policy, the policy will lapse.
3ETI means that if the policyholder still wants the insurance protection but doesn't want to pay any more premiums, the existing cash value of his policy is treated as a single premium which is used to buy protection for future years. The number of years of protection he will get varies directly with the quantum of the cash value.
What is the difference between a paid-up policy and ETI?
The difference between a paid-up policy and ETI is that:
* A paid-up policy has lower sum assured than the original policy but ETI has the same or higher sum assured than the original policy (assuming no indebtedness);
* A paid-up policy will mature on the same date as the original policy, whereas for ETI, the maturity date may or may not be the same date as the original policy as the period of cover depends on how much cash value there is in the original policy and the policyholder's age on the date of premium default.']",https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/growing-your-savings/cpf-investment-schemes/if-i-run-out-of-cpf-monies-to-pay-the-premiums-of-my
How will the proceeds of my Academic Staff Provident Fund Approved Investment Scheme (ASPFAIS) Part V insurance policy and/or rider be distributed?,"['In general, premiums of Part V insurance policies and riders (if any) paid using Academic Staff Provident Fund (ASPF) monies or cash prior to the transfer of the policy to CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) would be treated as though the premiums were paid using CPF monies.

Under CAYE, the agency/company you provided a service to will help you contribute into your MA each time it makes a service payment to you.
Your CAYE contributions are based on your estimated annual revenue and expenses. Thus, CAYE contributions are an estimate of your MediSave payable. After you declare your NTI for the year, your MediSave payable will be computed.
If your total Contribute-As-You-Earn (CAYE) contributions are higher than your MediSave payable for the latest year, your excess CAYE contributions will be used to offset your outstanding MediSave payable from previous years1. Any remaining CAYE contributions will then be refunded to you.

Employed directly by an overseas employer
You should research your prospective employer to ensure that it has legitimate business presence in Singapore and whether it is registered with Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA).

If your CPF contributions are not paid on time or discrepancies are found, please approach your employer for clarification immediately while documentary evidence is fresh.√Ç¬†If your employer does not provide you with a satisfactory explanation, you can lodge a report with CPF Board.

Employed through an Employer of Record (EOR) to work for an overseas entity
You may consider working for an overseas entity through an EOR. An EOR serves as the employer, taking on employment-related roles such as paying salaries for its employees, withholding taxes, paying employment-related benefits, while its employees perform work for its client, e.g. an overseas company.
When you√¢¬Ä¬ôre employed through an EOR to work for an overseas entity, the EOR is your employer and will be responsible for paying your CPF contributions. Do read through your employment contract with the EOR to ensure your rights are protected.
While it may be easier to take enforcement actions against an EOR located in Singapore compared to an overseas entity, you should still exercise caution when seeking employment with an EOR.

Patients who are Singaporeans (SC) or Permanent Residents (PR) may use their own or their approved dependants√¢¬Ä¬ô MediSave for overseas elective treatments. Approved dependants refer to spouses, children, parents, siblings and/or grandchildren.
Patients will need a referral from MediSave-accredited healthcare provider, Health Management International (HMI), if they wish to use MediSave to pay for the medical bill. The patient can contact HMI at 6334 7283 to check if they have affiliated hospital(s) in the country where they wish to receive treatment.
**Use of MediSave for Overseas Treatment√Ç¬†- Medical Emergency/Treatment not Available in Singapore**
MediSave is primarily meant to help Singaporeans and Permanent Residents pay for their major inpatient hospitalisation expenses and selected outpatient expenses locally. When travelling overseas, CPF members should consider purchasing travel insurance to protect against the risk of incurring unforeseen medical expenses.
Appeals to use MediSave for overseas emergency treatments will be considered on a case-by-case basis if the following conditions are fulfilled:
1. The patient must be a Singapore Citizen (SC) or Permanent Resident (PR) of Singapore (Please note that the patient may appeal to use his/ her or their approved dependants√¢¬Ä¬ô MediSave to pay for their own overseas hospitalisations. Approved dependants refer to a member√¢¬Ä¬ôs spouse, children, parents, siblings and/or grandparents.); and
2. The use of MediSave is only limited to inpatient admission that exceeds a minimum of eight hours or day surgery, which has been assessed to be a medical emergency by our Medical Advisors. It cannot be used for outpatient treatments.
For such cases, the following supporting documents have to be submitted to the Ministry of Health (MOH) for consideration on a case-by-case basis:
1. Original copy (Certified true copy by Hospital is accepted) of the patient's medical records - Discharge summary, operation notes (if any) or clinical notes showing the history, diagnosis and treatment plan for the patient.
2. Original copy (Certified true copy by Hospital is accepted) of the final hospital bill for the patient.
3. Passport information - showing passport holder and the entry/departure of the foreign country.
4. Bank Statement showing the bank account number and name of account holder (Only Singapore local banks are accepted).
5. Completed Medical Claims Authorisation Form (MCAF), to authorise the use of MediSave upon an approval. You may find a copy of the MCAF on the [MOH website](https://www.moh.gov.sg/cost-financing/healthcare-schemes-subsidies/medisave).

If premiums were not priced by age, premiums will keep escalating as a growing number of elderly would need to be supported by a decreasing number of younger policyholders. This will impose an increasing burden on future generations and will not be sustainable. Instead, the Government provides subsidies and premium assistance to those who are unable to afford their premiums.
MediShield Life is different from the social insurance schemes in other countries, where the insurance contributions paid by the working population (e.g. through payroll taxes) are used to fund payouts, which are mostly used by the elderly or sick.']",https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/healthcare-financing/medishield-life/are-msl-premiums-increasing-due-to-elderly

Why did MediShield Life premiums have to increase in 2021 especially during the economic downturn?,"['Premiums did not change for the first five years of MediShield Life, in line with the Government√¢¬Ä¬ôs earlier commitment. They need to be adjusted for the MediShield Life Fund to remain solvent and sustainable.
Premiums are priced by actuaries based on established actuarial principles, taking into account claims experience such as utilisation rates and cost of medical treatment, scheme benefits, among other factors.
There are three main reasons for the premium increases:
(1) The number of claimants has increased by about 30% and the annual payouts have increased by about 40% over the last four years. This accounted for the bulk of the premium increases i.e. about two-third;
(2) One-quarter of the premium increases is from refreshing the claim limits; and,

"Annual Value is an assessment criterion for MediShield Life premium subsidies. Will there be any flexibility in premium payment for ""asset-rich, cash-poor"" citizens?","['In general, Government subsidies should be targeted at those in greater need. The assessment approach for MediShield Life Premium Subsidies uses the household monthly income per person and Annual Value (AV) of homes as a way to assess the household√¢¬Ä¬ôs means and better target these subsidies. In addition, those who own multiple properties will not be eligible for Premium Subsidies.
The household assessment process strikes a balance between being more precise in assessing applicants√¢¬Ä¬ô means and keeping the process simpler for applicants and administratively practical. The approach aims to provide us with a fair and objective basis to take a person's income and wealth into consideration.
Annual Value is a relevant consideration, as among those with similar income, those who live in homes with a higher AV would generally be better off than those who live in homes with a lower AV. The $21,000 AV threshold covers all HDB flats and a small number of private properties. Similarly, Singapore Residents who own multiple properties would also have more means to pay for their premiums.
Aside from premium subsidies, Singapore Citizens who belong to the Pioneer Generation or Merdeka Generation are given subsidies from 40% - 60% or from 5% - 10% respectively.
For Singaporeans with difficulties affording MediShield Life premiums even after the various government subsidies, there will be Additional Premium Support available on a case by case basis, in line with family circumstances.
Those living in homes with higher AVs or own multiple properties will also continue to benefit from substantial healthcare subsidies e.g. at polyclinics and public hospitals. From time to time, they also receive MediSave top-ups to help them with healthcare expenses.

Such a design meant that drug companies had no incentive to charge lower prices for drug treatments that cost less. As a result, we paid higher prices for many cancer drugs as compared to other countries such as Australia, South Korea and the United Kingdom.

If you are a subsidised patient and still face difficulties affording your bills, you can approach a Medical Social Worker (MSW) in your PHI for financial assistance such as MediFund.
* If you have an IP that is being renewed between 1 Apr 2023 and 30 Sep 2023, and have received cancer drug treatment between 1 Jan 2023 and 31 Mar 2023, insurers have committed to preserve your current IP coverage until 30 Sep 2023.

Do I need a private Integrated Shield Plan (IP)?,"['All Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents are covered under MediShield Life no matter how long you live, regardless of age or health condition. MediShield Life helps to pay for large hospital bills and selected costly outpatient treatments such as dialysis and chemotherapy for cancer. It is sized for subsidised treatment in B2/C wards of the public hospitals.
You do not need an Integrated Shield Plan (IP) if you plan to stay in B2/C wards in public hospitals which are heavily subsidised. In fact, majority of Singaporeans, even those who had bought IP, chose to stay in B2/C wards. In particular, eight in 10 seniors choose B2/C wards when they are hospitalised.
If you buy an IP but choose to stay in B2/C wards in public hospitals, you might want to reconsider whether you should pay for additional private insurance.
However, if you are firm in choosing B1/A wards in public hospitals or seeking treatment at private hospitals, you can consider getting an IP that matches your ward preference. If so, you should be prepared to pay additional premiums for the additional coverage.']",https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/healthcare-financing/supplements/do-i-need-a-private-integrated-shield-plan-ip
Will I receive hospitalisation subsidies if I choose A ward type in public hospital or choose to go to a private hospital?,"['You will not receive any hospitalisation subsidy in an A ward type in a public hospital or at a private hospital.

What should I consider when I purchase or review my Integrated Shield Plan (IP) coverage with my insurer?,"['Buying and maintaining an√Ç¬†Integrated Shield Plan (IP) is a significant lifetime financial commitment. The degree of protection you need evolves and changes with your circumstances and age. As you reach your retirement years, your earning power is likely to reduce while your premiums will rise sharply and your priorities may shift. Depending on your hospital/ ward preferences, you may not want to pay additional premiums for an IP. You should consider the following carefully:
1. Are you likely to choose to seek treatment or be hospitalised at a public or private hospital?
2. If you intend to go to a public hospital, will you choose a B2/C ward (six to eight beds) or Standard B1 ward (four beds) or A ward (single bed), taking into account affordability?
3. If you intend to stay in B2/C wards, you need not buy an IP. This is because MediShield Life is generally sufficient as payouts are pegged to B2/C wards after government subsidies. The deductible and co-insurance can be paid via MediSave, as well as any remaining co-payment subject to the MediSave withdrawal limits.
4. If you prefer to go to a private hospital, assess your means and ability to pay the additional premiums throughout your lifetime. Your annual premiums will increase sharply with age, which means that your premiums will be much higher in your retirement years. Based on the median premiums for each IP plan type, you can potentially save a significant sum.

1. Discuss with the organisation on nominating a person holding an official position (e.g. General Manager or Chief Executive) within the organisation, or
2. Nominate a trustee/trust company to receive your CPF savings on behalf of the organisation.
Please note that the person holding an official position in the organisation or the trustee/trust company will receive the CPF savings in his/its own right.

For instance, MOE has suspended the TFL repayment and interest from 1 June 2020 to√Ç¬†30 September 2021 to support households affected by Covid-19, and had done so in the past as well. On the other hand, repayment of the CPF education loan and interest cannot be suspended as it is to restore the member√¢¬Ä¬ôs CPF savings for his retirement needs, and retirement security remains important, if not more so, during economic downturns.

What are the alternative options available to finance my tuition fee besides the CPF Education Loan Scheme?,"['Besides the CPF Education Loan√Ç¬†Scheme, there are [other ways to finance a tertiary education](/content/dam/web/member/faq/other-schemes/documents/Other_ways_to_finance_education.pdf) (PDF, 0.5MB) in Singapore. You may want to consider the following factors when deciding on the best option to finance your studies:
* Eligibility
> There are different eligibility criteria for each financing option. For example, in order to be eligible for the MOE Tuition Fee Loan, an applicant needs to be a recipient of the MOE Tuition Grant. For more information on your eligibility, you may refer to the relevant websites (for example, MOE and banks) that provide details of the various financing options.
>
>
* Amount of coverage for tuition fee
> The various financing options may not cover up to 100% of your tuition fee. You may want to refer to the respective website of the various financing options to find out how much coverage is provided for your tuition fee.
* Rate of interest
> The rate of interest varies across different loans, so you may want to compare the rate of interest to find out which loan is most suitable for you. It is also important to know when interest will start accruing for your loan. For example, for the MOE Tuition Fee Loan, there is no interest accrued during the course of your study; whereas for the CPF Education Loan scheme, interest starts to accrue as soon as the CPF savings is deducted from a member√¢¬Ä¬ôs account.
* Repayment
> It is important to know when you are expected to start the repayment of your tuition fee loan and how you will finance the repayment of your tuition fee loan (i.e. minimum monthly repayment amount). You may also want to compare the maximum repayment period for each loan.

Part-time courses are generally tailored for working adults who are in a better position to pay their tuition fees as they have their own income.

I intend to take a loan to finance my education and I will repay it promptly upon my graduation. Which is better for me √¢¬Ä¬ì the MOE Tuition Fee Loan (TFL) or CPF Education Loan? ,"['The MOE TFL is a better option as it is interest-free during the course of study, unlike the CPF loan where interest starts to accrue from the time of withdrawal. This means that if you repay the loan fully right after graduation, you will not incur any interest at all for the TFL. For scenarios comparing the two loans, please refer to the following document:
* [Comparing the CPF Education Loan Scheme and MOE Tuition Fee Loan](/content/dam/web/member/faq/other-schemes/documents/Comparison_EDNSchemeandMOETuitionFeeLoanScheme.pdf)
Additionally, being a loan from MOE, the TFL repayment and interest can be suspended in periods of economic downturn. For instance, MOE has suspended the TFL repayment and interest from 1 June 2020 to 30 September 2021 to support households affected by Covid-19, and had done so in the past as well. On the other hand, repayment of the CPF education loan and interest cannot be suspended as it is to restore the member√¢¬Ä¬ôs CPF savings for his retirement needs, and retirement security remains important, if not more so, during economic downturns.']",https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/other-schemes/cpf-education-loan-scheme/i-intend-to-take-a-loan-to-finance-my-education-which-is-better
"Compared to the MOE Tuition Fee Loan, isn't the CPF Education Loan a better option as I will pay the interest to my parents' Ordinary Account so that they can benefit from it?","['This is not the right way to think about it. The TFL is interest-free during the course of study. This means that if you repay the loan fully right after graduation, you will not incur any interest at all for the TFL. In other words, by not using your parent√¢¬Ä¬ôs OA savings, government will be paying your parent an OA interest of up to 3.5% during your period of study.
On the other hand, if you borrow from your parent√¢¬Ä¬ôs OA, the interest starts to accrue from the time the savings are withdrawn to pay the educational institutions. When you repay the accrued interest to your parents√¢¬Ä¬ô OA, you are simply restoring their OA to what government would have paid them anyway. There is no additional benefit to them.
Another reason why TFL is a better option is because the TFL repayment and interest can be suspended in periods of economic downturn. For instance, MOE has suspended the TFL repayment and interest from 1 June 2020 to 30 September 2021 to support households affected by Covid-19, and had done so in the past as well.
None of the above interest-free advantages on the TFL could be applied to the CPF Education Loan Scheme. This is because the interest paid by you, is what would have naturally accrued to your parents during the period of study and during the pandemic, and must be restored because CPF savings are essential to them in retirement.']",https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/other-schemes/cpf-education-loan-scheme/moe-tfl-cpf-education-loan-scheme-a-better-option

2. Stay vigilant and only click on links from trusted sources.

For mobile devices, you can hold your finger down on the link so that a window pops out and shows you the full address of the link.
3. Do verify the sender
* For email, ensure that the sender√¢¬Ä¬ôs email address is correctly spelt and√Ç¬†ends with @cpf.gov.sg or @e.cpf.gov.sg
* For WhatsApp, ensure that the sender is √¢¬Ä¬úCPF Board√¢¬Ä¬ù, our official business account, with a green badge. ![](/content/dam/web/member/faq/images/cpfwhatsappgreenbadge.png)
* For SMS, ensure that the sender is √¢¬Ä¬úCPF Board√¢¬Ä¬ù from 1 Aug 2022. We will not send SMS from other IDs.
* Telephone calls from CPF officers to you will not begin with a prefix ""+65"". If a call has a prefix with a plus (+) sign, it is likely to be an overseas call.
* Messages from CPF Board may contain links to the CPF website or other Government websites. Please check that the domain of such links end with √¢¬Ä¬ú.gov.sg√¢¬Ä¬ù before clicking on them.

How do I pay CPF contributions using PayNow QR?,"['PayNow QR is a quick way for you to make payment for CPF contributions by scanning a QR code, via existing mobile banking apps. PayNow QR allows you to use corporate or personal accounts to pay your CPF contributions. You would have to scan the PayNow QR code using a [PayNow participating bank√¢¬Ä¬ô](https://abs.org.sg/consumer-banking/pay-now)s app in order for the payment to be processed successfully. Any payment made without using the issued PayNow QR code (e.g. making payment directly to CPF Board√¢¬Ä¬ôs UEN or changing the details after scanning the PayNow QR code)√Ç¬†or multiple payments made using the same PayNow QR code will be refunded with the reference code √¢¬Ä¬úCPF√¢¬Ä¬ù.
The maximum amount you can transfer via PayNow QR is√Ç¬†$200,000, subject to daily and monthly limits set by your bank. If your total CPF submission amount exceeds $200,000, you will need to perform another submission via CPF EZPay. For example, if your total CPF submission amount is $300,000, you will need to make two separate CPF submissions via CPF EZPay consisting of $200,000 and $100,000 respectively.
Please make sure you have sufficient funds in your bank account before the payment is deducted. If you have set a PayNow payment limit with your bank, do ensure that the limit is sufficient to pay your CPF contributions. Some banks may charge an administrative fee for each unsuccessful payment attempt.
**Personal bank account**
On the day of submission, you must ensure that you scan the PayNow QR code and pay using your PayNow√Ç¬†participating bank's√Ç¬†app before it expires at 23:59 hrs. Once the QR code has expired, you will not be able to make the payment, and will need to resubmit your CPF contributions and get a new PayNow QR code.
After your payment has been made, your payment status will be updated as ""Paid"" in CPF EZPay almost instantly.
**Corporate bank account**
Two-level authorisation (Maker and Checker) is required for PayNow Corporate account users. Maker needs to scan the PayNow QR code to prepare the transaction before 23:59 hrs on the day of submission. Thereafter, the Checker needs to login to the banking app to approve the transaction. Though there is no time limit for approving the transaction, it is advisable for the Checker to approve the payment immediately to avoid incurring late payment interest.
If the Maker did not scan the PayNow QR code before it expires, you√¢¬Ä¬ôll need to resubmit your CPF contributions and get a new PayNow QR code.

What are the changes to the CPF salary ceilings from 1 September 2023?,"['The CPF monthly and annual salary ceilings have been updated periodically in the past to keep pace with rising salaries.

If you own a property, which can last you to at least age 95, you can choose to withdraw your Retirement Account savings above your Basic Retirement Sum. If you were born in 1958 or after, you can also withdraw up to 20% of your Retirement Account (RA) savings as at age 65. This withdrawal amount includes the $5,000 that can be withdrawn from age 55.

With CPF LIFE, you can have peace of mind knowing that you will have a steady stream of lifelong income to support your retirement needs.

What are the CPF LIFE plans available and which is the right plan for me?,"['There are three CPF LIFE plans available for you to choose from √¢¬Ä¬ì Escalating Plan, Standard Plan and Basic Plan.
It is important to plan for your retirement with inflation in mind. Assuming you are receiving $1,000 of monthly payouts today, in 20 years√¢¬Ä¬ô time, you may need about $1,500 to buy the same items as today. Which plan you choose depends on how willing you are to adjust your retirement lifestyle, as things become more expensive.
![Three CPF LIFE plans available](/content/dam/web/member/faq/retirement-income/images/ThreeCPFLIFEPlansAvailable.png)
If you are worried about the rising costs of living, you can consider the Escalating Plan which provides monthly payouts that increase by 2% every year for life. The increasing payouts protects you against inflation and generally helps you maintain your retirement lifestyle.√Ç¬†Read more about√Ç¬†[how the CPF LIFE Escalating Plan works](/member/faq/retirement-income/monthly-payouts/how-does-the-cpf-life-escalating-plan-work-).

Read more about√Ç¬†[how the CPF LIFE Standard Plan works](/member/faq/retirement-income/monthly-payouts/how-does-the-cpf-life-standard-plan-work-).

How is CPF LIFE attractive?,"['CPF LIFE is an attractive retirement payout scheme for several reasons:
1. **Payouts for life** CPF LIFE provides you with retirement payouts no matter how long you live, unlike most private retirement income plans that only do so for a limited period. This gives you peace of mind knowing that your retirement income will last no matter how long you live.
2. **Safe product with high, risk-free returns** CPF LIFE monies are guaranteed by the Singapore Government, and provide high, risk-free returns, making it a safe and secure retirement income plan. Annuities offered by the private sector are subject to investment market returns which can be unpredictable.
3. **Lower costs** Being non-profit and administered by CPF Board, the CPF LIFE scheme does not incur costs from advertising and agents√¢¬Ä¬ô commissions.

Are CPF LIFE payouts guaranteed?,"['CPF LIFE payouts are not guaranteed, but they are designed to be stable. Any adjustments to CPF LIFE payouts are expected to be small and gradual.

How does the CPF LIFE Standard Plan work?,"['The CPF LIFE Standard Plan provides level payouts. This plan is suitable for members who are comfortable with buying less and maintaining a modest lifestyle to cope with rising prices.
Compared to the CPF LIFE Escalating Plan, the Standard Plan provides higher payouts at the start but it doesn't increase over time to keep up with the rising prices. Hence, the payouts will eventually be lower than Escalating Plan payouts.
Under this plan, all your Retirement Account savings will be deducted as CPF LIFE premium when you join CPF LIFE.
Your CPF LIFE monthly payouts will first be paid from your CPF LIFE premium. When your CPF LIFE premium is depleted, you'll continue to receive the monthly payouts from the interest that you and other CPF LIFE members have accumulated, no matter how long you live.']",https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/retirement-income/monthly-payouts/how-does-the-cpf-life-standard-plan-work-

How does the CPF LIFE Basic Plan work?,"['CPF LIFE Basic Plan is a legacy plan carried over from the time CPF LIFE was first introduced in 2009. Many members would find the Standard or Escalating Plan more suited to their needs.
The Basic Plan provides lower monthly payouts than the Standard Plan, and will get progressively lower when your combined CPF balances eventually fall below $60,000. This is because the extra interest earned on the first $60,000 of your CPF balances is credited to your Retirement Account (RA) and paid as part of your monthly payouts. As your balances decrease due to payouts, the extra interest earned and subsequent payouts will also decrease.
Under the Basic Plan, about 10-20% of your RA savings will be deducted as CPF LIFE premium when you join CPF LIFE, which can be any time from 65 to 70.
Your monthly payout will first be paid from your RA until 90. Thereafter, monthly payouts will be paid from your CPF LIFE premium.

CPF monies are invested by the CPF Board (CPFB) in Special Singapore Government Securities (SSGS). SSGS are issued specially by the Government to CPFB. The proceeds from SSGS are pooled with the rest of the Government√¢¬Ä¬ôs funds, such as government surplus, and proceeds from land sales. The co-mingled funds are invested by the Government√¢¬Ä¬ôs fund manager, GIC, for long-term returns. GIC was created in 1981, to invest the Government√¢¬Ä¬ôs assets for long-term returns.
CPF monies are not managed by Temasek, and proceeds from SSGS are also not invested with Temasek. Temasek is a separate company that owns and manages its assets.

I am aged 55 and above. What will happen when my Special Account is closed and what is the rationale for doing so? ,"['Today, members aged 55 and above have two CPF accounts that hold savings intended for retirement payouts: the Special Account (SA) and the Retirement Account (RA). Both SA and RA savings earn the same long-term interest rate. However, some SA savings can be withdrawn on demand from age 55. As a principle, only savings that cannot be withdrawn on demand should earn the long-term interest rate, and savings that can be withdrawn on demand should earn the short-term interest rate. 

To rationalise the CPF system and better align CPF interest rates to the nature of CPF savings, we will close your SA if you are aged 55 and above from early 2025. SA savings will be transferred to your RA (up to your Full Retirement Sum) and will continue to earn the long-term interest rate. The remaining SA savings will be transferred to your Ordinary Account (OA), where they remain withdrawable and will earn the short-term interest rate. 

You can choose to transfer your OA savings to the RA at any time, up to the prevailing Enhanced Retirement Sum to earn long-term interest rates and receive higher retirement payouts. Once transferred, the RA savings can only be streamed out to you in retirement payouts.

You will be notified after the transfer of all SA savings to your RA and/or OA, and closure of your SA in early 2025. You will also be able to check the amounts transferred from your SA to your RA and/or OA from your CPF statement. No action is required from you now.

Watch the video on how the SA will be closed for you from early 2025. 

More details on the implementation date will be shared in the second half of 2024.

"Once I meet my Full Retirement Sum, my Special Account savings will be transferred to the Ordinary Account which pays lower interest.

From 1 January 2025, the ERS will be raised to four times of the Basic Retirement Sum to allow members to save more in the RA and receive higher payouts, if they want. 

With the change, the ERS in 2025 would be $426,0001, up from $319,500 in 2024.  Hence, if you are aged 55 and above in 2025, you can save up to $426,000 in the RA.
