What are the CPF LIFE plans available and which is the right plan for me?,what-are-the-cpf-life-plans-available-and-which-is-the-right-plan-for-me,"There are three CPF LIFE plans to choose from – Escalating Plan, Standard Plan and Basic Plan.   Do plan for your retirement with inflation in mind. For example, if your monthly expenditure is $1,000 today, you may need about $1,500 monthly payouts to maintain the same lifestyle in 20 years’ time. Choose your CPF LIFE plan based on how willing you are to adjust your retirement lifestyle, as things become more expensive.     If you are worried about the rising costs of living, you can  consider the Escalating Plan which provides monthly payouts that start lower initially but grow by 2% every year for life. The growing payouts protects you against inflation and generally helps you maintain your retirement lifestyle. Read more about how the CPF LIFE Escalating Plan works .   If you are willing to live a more modest lifestyle and buy less as years pass, you may find the Standard Plan which provides steady payouts suitable for you. Payouts do not grow to protect you against inflation so you'll have to lower your lifestyle to buy less as things get more expensive in the years ahead. Payouts start higher than the Escalating Plan, but will eventually become lower than the Escalating Plan. Read more about how the CPF LIFE Standard Plan works .   If you don’t mind starting with lower monthly payouts which will be progressively lower later on, then the Basic Plan is good enough. The Basic Plan is a legacy plan carried over from the time CPF LIFE was first introduced in 2009. Compared to the Standard Plan which gives higher and steady monthly payouts, Basic Plan payouts are lower and will get progressively lower when your combined CPF balances eventually fall below $60,000. Read more about how the CPF LIFE Basic Plan works .   In all three plans, you will enjoy payouts no matter how long you live, your premiums will enjoy risk-free CPF interest rates , and any remaining CPF LIFE premium balance will be given to your beneficiaries, together with your remaining CPF savings when you pass on. In other words, you and your loved ones will always get back the premium that you have put into CPF LIFE."

You should also communicate your CPF rights clearly to the overseas employer before the start of your employment to avoid subsequent disputes. If your CPF contributions are not paid on time or discrepancies are found, please approach your employer for clarification immediately while documentary evidence is fresh. If your employer does not provide you with a satisfactory explanation, you can lodge a report with CPF Board.   Do note that enforcement actions would not be effective against an overseas employer with no presence in Singapore and is not registered with ACRA. CPF Board may not be able to assist you in such claims. You may wish to exercise caution when seeking employment with such employer.   Employed through an Employer of Record (EOR) to work for an overseas entity   You may consider working for an overseas entity through an EOR. An EOR serves as the employer, taking on employment-related roles such as paying salaries for its employees, withholding taxes, paying employment-related benefits, while its employees perform work for its client, e.g. an overseas company.   When you’re employed through an EOR to work for an overseas entity, the EOR is your employer and will be responsible for paying your CPF contributions. Do read through your employment contract with the EOR to ensure your rights are protected.   While it may be easier to take enforcement actions against an EOR located in Singapore compared to an overseas entity, you should still exercise caution when seeking employment with an EOR. The recovery of any unpaid CPF contributions depends on the EOR’s financial ability to pay up the arrears. Do check with the EOR early if any discrepancies are found in your CPF contributions, while documentary evidence is fresh and before your CPF arrears accumulate."

What are the basic investment classes?,what-are-the-basic-investment-classes,"Most investments fall into one of three basic asset classes — cash equivalents, bonds and stocks (also called shares or equities).   Cash equivalents Cash equivalent (e.g. fixed deposit) investments are usually investments which have low risk of losing value but offer relatively low potential returns. Cash equivalents are typically used to hold money that will be needed in the near future or to hold assets temporarily while considering how to invest the assets for the long term.   Bonds Bonds, often referred to as fixed income securities or debt securities, are loans to a corporation or government to finance its operations. A bond represents the corporation's or government's promise to repay at a specified date (at maturity) the amount borrowed from investors. The bond generally earns interest. Bonds also increase or decrease in value based on market conditions.   Examples of bonds include government bonds and corporate bonds.   Stocks Stocks represent ownership in a corporation. If you own stock in the XYZ Corporation, you are part owner of that company. Stocks may provide income in the form of dividends. Stock investments increase in value when the price of the share goes up and vice versa. Historically, over periods of several years or more, many types of stocks have increased in value. However, past performance is no guarantee of future results."

What is an Investment-Linked Insurance Policy (ILP)?,what-is-an-investment-linked-insurance-policy-ilp,"Under the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS), you can invest in various Investment-Linked Insurance Policies (ILPs). An ILP is made up of an insurance component coupled with an investment fund managed by a professional fund manager. Insurers usually set up two or more sub-funds for each ILP with differing investment objectives to suit the risk appetite of different types of policyholders. These underlying ILP sub-funds are similar to unit trusts. The allocation of premiums across these sub-funds may be fixed by the insurer or decided by the policyholder, depending on the structure of the ILP. The advantage of an ILP is that it effectively combines investments in a unit trust with purchase of insurance coverage. This is also its disadvantage. An investor might prefer a more flexible combination of insurance coverage and unit trust investment that is not offered by any of the ILPs included under the CPFIS."

Why did MediShield Life premiums have to increase in 2021 especially during the economic downturn?,why-did-medishield-life-premiums-have-to-increase-in-2021-especially-during-the-economic-downturn,"Premiums did not change for the first five years of MediShield Life, in line with the Government’s earlier commitment. They need to be adjusted for the MediShield Life Fund to remain solvent and sustainable.   Premiums are priced by actuaries based on established actuarial principles, taking into account claims experience such as utilisation rates and cost of medical treatment, scheme benefits, among other factors.   There are three main reasons for the premium increases:   (1) The number of claimants has increased by about 30% and the annual payouts have increased by about 40% over the last four years. This accounted for the bulk of the premium increases i.e. about two-third;   (2) One-quarter of the premium increases is from refreshing the claim limits; and,   (3) The remaining 8% (or one-twelve) of the premium increases supports the benefit enhancements including those implemented since 2018, such as the extension of coverage to inpatient hospices and serious pregnancy complications.   The Government has committed up to $2.2 billion in premium subsidies and support over the next three years, to help Singapore Residents with their premiums.   Premium payment will be deferred until end December 2021, for those who have insufficient MediSave balances and are unable to pay their premiums due to the economic impact of COVID-19. If you need more help, you can also apply for Additional Premium Support  for assistance with your premiums."
Why are MediShield Life premiums increasing as we get older?,why-are-medishield-life-premiums-increasing-as-we-get-older,"MediShield Life premiums are age-based (i.e. set in line with the risks for each age group).   With an ageing population, it is important to try to avoid intergenerational cross-subsidy, where the young has to pay for the old. If premiums were not priced by age, premiums will keep escalating as a growing number of elderly would need to be supported by a decreasing number of younger policyholders. This will impose an increasing burden on future generations and will not be sustainable. Instead, the Government provides subsidies and premium assistance to those who are unable to afford their premiums.   MediShield Life is different from the social insurance schemes in other countries, where the insurance contributions paid by the working population (e.g. through payroll taxes) are used to fund payouts, which are mostly used by the elderly or sick."
Will MediShield Life premiums increase due to the increase in GST?,will-medishield-life-premiums-increase-due-to-the-increase-in-gst,"MediShield Life premiums are inclusive of the prevailing GST rate.   In Budget 2022, the Minister for Finance announced that the GST rate will be increased from 7% to 8% with effect from 1 January 2023 and from 8% to 9% with effect from 1 January 2024. As GST is levied on MediShield Life premiums at the prevailing GST rate, the premiums will increase accordingly.   The new MediShield Life premium rate table (for policy periods on or after 1 Jan 2023) can be found on the CPF website, under View premiums ."

How does the CPF LIFE Basic Plan work?,how-does-the-cpf-life-basic-plan-work,"CPF LIFE Basic Plan is a legacy plan carried over from the time CPF LIFE was first introduced in 2009. Many members would find the Standard or Escalating Plan more suited to their needs.   If you opt for the Basic Plan, about 80-90% of your Retirement Account (RA) savings will be directly used to provide payouts until age 90. The remaining 10-20% will be deducted as your CPF LIFE premium when you join CPF LIFE and used to provide payouts from age 90 for the rest of your life. As less is used for your CPF LIFE premium, the monthly payout will be lower compared to the Standard Plan.   The monthly payouts under Basic Plan will get progressively lower when your combined CPF balances eventually fall below $60,000. This is because the extra interest earned on the first $60,000 of your CPF balances is credited to your RA and factored into your monthly payouts. As your balances are withdrawn over time to provide you with monthly payouts, the amount of monthly payouts and extra interest will decrease when your balances fall below $60,000."

Otherwise, you may underestimate your lifespan and find your savings depleted with many more years to live when you are no longer able to work.   With CPF LIFE, you do not need to worry about being caught in such a situation but have the assurance of having a steady stream of income, no matter what age you live to."
How will participating in Contribute As You Earn (CAYE) affect my MediSave contributions payable?,how-will-participating-in-contribute-as-you-earn-caye-affect-my-medisave-contributions-payable,"Self-employed persons (SEPs) are required to contribute to their MediSave Account (MA) if their annual Net Trade Income (NTI) is more than $6,000. Contribute As You Earn (CAYE) does not change the amount of MediSave contributions you have to make based on your NTI. The only change concerns how the contributions are made. Under CAYE, the agency/company you provided a service to will help you contribute into your MA each time it makes a service payment to you.   Your CAYE contributions are based on your estimated annual revenue and expenses. Thus, CAYE contributions are an estimate of your MediSave payable. After you declare your NTI for the year, your MediSave payable will be computed.   If your total Contribute As You Earn (CAYE) contributions are higher than your MediSave payable for the latest year, your excess CAYE contributions will be used to offset your outstanding MediSave payable from previous years 1 . Any remaining CAYE contributions will then be refunded to you.   If your total CAYE contributions are lower than your MediSave payable, you’ll be required to top up the remaining amount. You’ll be notified accordingly, and you can choose to make payment via lump-sum payment(s) or sign up for GIRO instalments.   1 This will take effect for CAYE contributions made from 2023. Please write to us if you do not wish to use your CAYE contributions to offset your outstanding MediSave payable from previous years."

Any excess thereafter will be refunded to him. He can also choose to retain the excess CAYE contributions in his MediSave Account (MA).   Example:   Based on his estimated income of $22,000 for 2023, Sam contributed $2,200 via CAYE. In the following year, he declared that he earned a lower Net Trade Income of $19,000 for 2023. As such, Sam’s MediSave payable for his work done in 2023 is $1,900. Hence, he has excess CAYE contributions of $300 for the year. Sam also has an outstanding MediSave payable of $100 incurred in 2022 which would be offset by the excess CAYE contributions, leaving a final excess amount of $200. This amount will be refunded to him 2 .

The SEP may write to us if he does not wish to use his CAYE contributions to offset his outstanding MediSave payable from previous years.   2 Sam may also choose not to use his CAYE contributions to offset his outstanding MediSave payable of $100 incurred in 2022. In this case, he will be refunded $300 instead."

What should I consider when I purchase or review my Integrated Shield Plan (IP) coverage with my insurer?,what-should-i-consider-when-i-purchase-or-review-my-integrated-shield-plan-ip-coverage-with-my-insurer,"Buying and maintaining an Integrated Shield Plan (IP) is a significant lifetime financial commitment. The degree of protection you need evolves and changes with your circumstances and age. As you reach your retirement years, your earning power is likely to reduce while your premiums will rise sharply and your priorities may shift. Depending on your hospital/ ward preferences, you may not want to pay additional premiums for an IP. You should consider the following carefully:   Are you likely to choose to seek treatment or be hospitalised at a public or private hospital? If you intend to go to a public hospital, will you choose a B2/C ward (six to eight beds) or Standard B1 ward (four beds) or A ward (single bed), taking into account affordability? If you intend to stay in B2/C wards, you need not buy an IP. This is because MediShield Life is generally sufficient as payouts are pegged to B2/C wards after government subsidies. The deductible and co-insurance can be paid via MediSave, as well as any remaining co-payment subject to the MediSave withdrawal limits. If you prefer to go to a private hospital, assess your means and ability to pay the additional premiums throughout your lifetime . Your annual premiums will increase sharply with age, which means that your premiums will be much higher in your retirement years. Based on the median premiums for each IP plan type, you can potentially save a significant sum. You may also refer to the checklist   when reviewing your IP coverage.   Did You Know? Your private medical insurance premiums could be ~5 times of your MediShield Life premiums for someone in their 70/80s. Click this link to find out more."

However, the claim limit would be pegged to the highest individual claim limit of the drugs in the combination.

Why is there revised criteria for new funds under the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS)?,why-is-there-revised-criteria-for-new-funds-under-the-cpf-investment-scheme-cpfis,"Currently, new funds applying for admission under the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) are evaluated based on a number of factors such as the capability of the fund managers, the investment philosophy of the fund, its key decision makers, the appropriateness and quality of its research and analysis, its portfolio construction and implementation, and its past performance. While this screening mechanism has helped to ensure a minimum standard for the funds under the CPFIS, more stringent criteria have been introduced so that funds under the CPFIS would better meet the objectives of CPFIS, which is to help members invest for the long-term for financial security in old age. In addition to setting a higher evaluation benchmark based on the current screening mechanism, the Board will also consider the funds' expense ratio. The latter will help lower the investment cost for members over the longer term. Funds submitted for admission under the CPFIS should also preferably have a performance track record of at least 3 years as this will allow the Board to better assess whether the funds are able to give consistently good performance against the benchmark."
What are the different evaluation factors for admission into CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) under the old and new entry criteria?,what-are-the-different-evaluation-factors-for-admission-into-cpf-investment-scheme-cpfis-under-the-old-and-new-entry-criteria,"New funds will continue to be evaluated according to existing evaluation factors. However, new funds will have to meet a higher benchmark, and henceforth funds admitted to CPF Investment Scheme will be among the top 25 percentile of funds. In addition, new funds will have to meet an expense ratio criterion pegged at the median of all funds in the same risk class. New funds should preferably also have a track record of at least 3-years.     Supplementary Information   The specific aspects of the investment process that are looked at during the evaluation process for Unit Trusts and Investment-Linked Insurance Policies include the following: Investment Philosophy; Key Decision Makers; Research and Analysis; Portfolio Construction; Implementation/Trading; and Past Performance."
How are the new Total Expense Ratio (TER) caps determined?,how-are-the-new-total-expense-ratio-ter-caps-determined,"The new Total Expense Ratio (TER) caps are determined based on the FY2012 median TERs (for the relevant risk categories) of CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) List A funds, and taking into account industry feedback.

Why is CPF Board reducing the Total Expense Ratio (TER) caps?,why-is-cpf-board-reducing-the-total-expense-ratio-ter-caps,"Reducing the Total Expense Ratio caps is part of CPF Board's continuous efforts to lower the cost of investing under the CPF Investment Scheme.

What is the target under the revised criteria?,what-proportion-of-funds-applying-for-admission-into-cpf-investment-scheme-cpfis-has-been-successful-what-is-the-target-under-the-revised-criteria,"Fund managers would generally assess the quality of their funds using the published CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) evaluation criteria before applying for inclusion under CPFIS. Thus far, funds within the top 50 percentile in their global peer group 1 have been successful in their application for admission into CPFIS, and the majority of funds that have applied for admission into CPFIS have been admitted. New funds will need to meet a higher criterion - i.e. they must be among the top 25 percentile of funds. Going forward, we do not expect a significant change in the success rate of application as managers would continue to assess the quality of their funds against the CPFIS evaluation criteria before application. 1 This refers to comparison of funds of similar asset class/strategy on a world-wide basis."

When should I invest in broadly diversified investments and when should I invest in narrowly focused investments?,when-should-i-invest-in-broadly-diversified-investments-and-when-should-i-invest-in-narrowly-focused-investments,"After you have made your decision on how much to invest in the three basic types of investments: cash, bonds and stocks (i.e. based on the amount of equity risk you are comfortable with), for most CPF members, investing in broadly diversified investments within that equity risk category should generally help minimise investment risk. In other words, investing in broadly diversified investments should help reduce risk compared with investing in narrowly focused investments in the same equity risk category.   However, there could also be reasons for investing in narrowly focused investments. You enjoy riskier investments, even when the odds are not necessarily in your favour. You are happy to take on the extra downside risk of not diversifying because of the potential for higher returns, although you are aware that a positive result is not guaranteed.   For investments in the same equity risk category, it is reasonable to expect potential rewards over the long term to be very roughly the same for both a broadly diversified investment and a narrowly focused investment. However, you may want to accept the higher downside risk of a narrowly focused investment if you think that a narrowly focused investment may give better results in the short term.   For example, if you are confident about the recovery of the Japanese economy in the short term, you may wish to invest in a Japan focused unit trust even though this unit trust has higher risk than a better diversified global equity unit trust."

What happens to my CPF savings when I turn 55?,what-happens-to-my-cpf-savings-when-i-turn-55,"When you turn 55, we will transfer your CPF savings, up to your Full Retirement Sum (FRS), to create your Retirement Account (RA). The savings in your RA is meant to provide you with payouts in retirement. Your Special Account (SA) savings will be transferred first , followed by your Ordinary Account (OA) savings.   From early 2025, the SA will be closed for members aged 55 and above to be in line with the principle that savings set aside for retirement should continue to earn long-term interest rates, while savings that can be withdrawn at any time should earn the short-term interest rate.   If you have savings in SA when the SA is closed, it will be transferred to the RA, up to your FRS, so that you can receive higher retirement payouts. Once you have set aside your FRS in RA, the remaining SA savings will be transferred to the OA and can be withdrawn at any time.   If you do not have enough RA savings to make up the FRS and have used your CPF savings for your property, we will use your CPF savings withdrawn for your property (including accrued interest) to meet your FRS. The maximum amount that can be used is your Basic Retirement Sum. When you sell your property, you will have to restore your RA up to your FRS with your sales proceeds.   It is not mandatory for you to top up your RA if you are unable to set aside your FRS . However, you may wish to top up your RA for higher monthly payouts. You can also enjoy tax relief for cash top-ups up to the FRS. After your SA is closed in early 2025, you can also opt to transfer your OA savings to the RA up to prevailing ERS to earn long-term interest rates and receive higher retirement payouts.   Did you know? You can use the Monthly payout estimator  to estimate how much you need to top up to reach your desired monthly payouts.   If you are born in 1958 or after and wish to start your monthly payouts, there will be another transfer of your SA and/or OA savings, up to your FRS, to your RA , if you have not met your FRS. This transfer allows you to receive higher monthly payouts.   Find out more about the retirement sums ."

How is CPF Board enhancing the disclosure of trailer fees?,how-is-cpf-board-enhancing-the-disclosure-of-trailer-fees,"Currently, fund managers pay trailer fees to their distributors who sell their funds to investors.

"Annual Value is an assessment criterion for MediShield Life Premium Subsidies. Will there be any flexibility in premium payment for ""asset-rich, cash-poor"" citizens?",annual-value-is-an-assessment-criterion-for-medishield-life-premium-subsidies-will-there-be-any-flexibility-in-premium-payment-for-asset-rich-cash-poor-citizens,"In general, Government subsidies should be targeted at those in greater need. The assessment approach for MediShield Life Premium Subsidies uses the household monthly income per person and Annual Value (AV) of homes as a way to assess the household’s means and better target these subsidies. In addition, those who own multiple properties will not be eligible for Premium Subsidies.   The household assessment process strikes a balance between being more precise in assessing applicants’ means and keeping the process simpler for applicants and administratively practical. The approach aims to provide us with a fair and objective basis to take a person's income and wealth into consideration.   Annual Value is a relevant consideration, as among those with similar income, those who live in homes with a higher AV would generally be better off than those who live in homes with a lower AV. The $25,000 AV threshold covers all HDB flats and a small number of private properties. Similarly, Singapore Residents who own multiple properties would also have more means to pay for their premiums.   Aside from Premium Subsidies, Singapore Citizens who belong to the Pioneer Generation or Merdeka Generation are given subsidies from 40% - 60% or 5% - 10% respectively.   For Singaporeans with difficulties affording MediShield Life premiums even after the various Government subsidies, there will be Additional Premium Support available on a case-by-case basis, in line with family circumstances.   Those living in homes with higher AVs or own multiple properties will also continue to benefit from substantial healthcare subsidies e.g. at polyclinics and public hospitals. From time to time, they also receive MediSave top-ups to help them with healthcare expenses.   Overall, premiums are aimed to be both fair and progressive, with general subsidies available to all Singapore Residents and support tiered to help those in greater need."

This is a fairer way of calculating the need for subsidies, because a family with more members may need more support, even if the total income they make is quite high. This is because the amount they can spend on each family member will be lower if there are more family members.   Families in a lower household income category will get a higher subsidy rate. In this way, we give more help to those who have less resources and need more help. This is part of being a compassionate and inclusive society."

What is the CPF Investment Scheme Risk Classification System?,what-is-the-cpf-investment-scheme-risk-classification-system,"The Risk Classification System is developed to help you determine which of the various investment options may be most appropriate for your investment circumstances, through better understanding of the level and type of risk associated and your risk tolerance. It splits the investment risk associated with Unit Trust , Investment-Linked Products and Exchange Traded Funds included under CPF Investment Scheme Funds into two broad categories, ""Equity Risk"" and ""Focus Risk"".   Equity Risk Equity Risk is related to exposure to the ""riskier"" types of investments in the Funds. The greater the proportion of assets invested in stocks, the higher the Equity Risk (i.e. higher risk category). Conversely, the greater the proportion of investments in bonds and cash, the lower the Equity Risk (i.e. lower risk category).   Focus Risk Focus Risk reflects how focused the investments of the Funds are in particular geographical regions, foreign countries, foreign currencies, industries or individual companies. A Fund that invests in shares of companies from around the world would have lower Focus Risk (i.e. broadly diversified) than a fund that invests in shares of companies from one country only (i.e. narrowly diversified).   The CPF Board does not give any consideration to nor has made any investigation on the investment objectives, financial situation or particular needs of the reader, any specific person or any group of persons. Accordingly, no warranty whatsoever is given and no liability whatsoever is accepted for any loss arising whether directly or indirectly as a result of the reader, any person or any group of persons acting on any information, opinion or statement expressed in these FAQs."

Why are the retirement sums increasing yearly?,why-are-the-retirement-sums-increasing-yearly,"The increase in retirement sums is due to the following:   Increase in cost of living As prices of goods and services rise over time, we will need to save more for retirement to ensure that our savings will still be sufficient to cover higher expenses in the future. Increase in life expectancy As people are living longer, we will need more savings to last throughout our retirement. Increase in standard of living As incomes increase over time, our basic retirement expectations and expenses will also naturally increase. Setting aside more savings allows us to receive higher monthly payouts to afford higher retirement expenses in future. However, if you are already 55, the yearly increase won't affect you. The  retirement sum you need to set aside depends on when you turn 55 and is fixed for the rest of your life.   It's important to keep in mind that the amount needed for retirement has increased over the years. For example, if the Full Retirement Sum had remained unchanged from $30,000 when it was first introduced in 1987 (previously known as the Minimum Sum), it would only provide a monthly payout of about $300 today. This amount would not be enough to cover daily living expenses and rent.   Overall, the goal of increasing retirement savings is to help individuals build a financial foundation that will enable them to support themselves through retirement."

"What are the differences between topping up my retirement savings, making a Voluntary Housing Refund and topping up my MediSave Account?",what-are-the-differences-between-topping-up-my-retirement-savings-making-a-voluntary-housing-refund-and-topping-up-my-medisave-account,"Find out what the differences between the various types of top-ups are below:   Topping up your retirement savings Voluntary Housing Refund Topping up your MediSave Account Top up/refund to Special Account (SA) for members below 55; or Retirement Account (RA) for members 55 or above. Ordinary Account (OA); and/or RA for members 55 or above and have not met their Full Retirement Sum (FRS) in their RA. MediSave Account (MA) Eligibility for tax relief You can enjoy tax relief if you made cash top-ups to yourself or your loved ones up to the current FRS . However, please note that tax relief would not apply if you made a CPF transfer. You will not be eligible for tax relief. For non self-employed persons: You get to enjoy tax relief for voluntary top-ups to MA.  If you are self-employed, you will enjoy  tax relief  on your  MediSave contributions   based on your annual net trade income (NTI). There will be no tax relief for your MediSave contributions if your assessed NTI for the year of assessment is zero or negative.   Top-up limit What is the maximum amount of top-ups I can receive? If you are below 55, you may top up your SA up to the current FRS. If you are 55 or above, you may top up your RA up to the current Enhanced Retirement Sum. You can check your top-up limit in your Retirement Dashboard . Can I voluntarily refund a portion of the CPF savings I used for my property? You can make a refund of any amount, capped at the full principal amount you have withdrawn for the property, along with the accrued interest. You may check the amount that you can refund through the Home Ownership Dashboard . Do note that after making a full voluntary housing refund of the CPF savings withdrawn and accrued interest, all CPF withdrawals including monthly housing loan instalments (if any) for the property will stop. What is the voluntary top-up limit to my MediSave Account? The maximum amount you can voluntarily top up to your MA is the difference between your Basic Healthcare Sum (BHS) and your current MA balance. Once your BHS has been reached, no further voluntary top-ups can be made to your MA. If you exceed your BHS from the top-up, the full amount of your top-up will be refunded to you. You can check your top-up limit with these steps. Withdrawal Top-ups are meant to boost your retirement income. They will be streamed out to you as monthly payouts and cannot be used for other purposes. You can continue to use your OA savings for the current or next property after making a voluntary housing refund. However, if you would like to use your OA for the same property, after making a voluntary refund of the full principal amount used and the accrued interest, you will need to re-apply to use your CPF savings. After turning 55 and setting aside the FRS, you can withdraw the remaining balance in your OA and SA in full or in part at any time. From 55, you can make retirement withdrawals from your OA and SA in full or in part, at any time for your immediate needs, provided you have set aside your FRS. MA savings are meant for your healthcare needs and cannot be withdrawn as cash. Application Top-ups can be made using cash and/or CPF transfers. How do I apply to make a top-up? Refund can only be made via cash. How can I make a voluntary refund of the housing amount withdrawn if I am not selling my property? Top-ups can only be made via cash.

For members who have set aside the FRS in the RA, these contributions will be channelled to the Ordinary Account (OA).   This will ensure that the additional contributions continue to earn the highest possible CPF interest rate to provide an even bigger boost to retirement payouts.

Both SA and RA savings earn the same long-term interest rate. However, some SA savings can be withdrawn on demand from age 55. As a principle, only savings that cannot be withdrawn on demand should earn the long-term interest rate, and savings that can be withdrawn on demand should earn the short-term interest rate.   To better align CPF interest rates to the nature of CPF savings in each CPF account, we will close your SA if you are aged 55 and above from early 2025. SA savings will be transferred to your RA, up to your Full Retirement Sum (FRS). These savings will continue to earn the long-term interest rate. If you have set aside your FRS, whether fully in cash or with a mixture of property and cash, any remaining SA savings will be transferred to your Ordinary Account (OA), where they remain withdrawable and will earn the short-term interest rate.   You can choose to transfer your OA savings to the RA at any time, up to the prevailing Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS) to earn long-term interest rates and receive higher retirement payouts. Once transferred, the RA savings can only be streamed out to you in retirement payouts. With the raised ERS from 1 January 2025 , more than 99% of the members aged 55 and above today would be able to transfer all their SA savings, that were channelled to the OA due to the closure of SA, to the RA.   You will be notified after the transfer of all SA savings to your RA and/or OA, and closure of your SA in early 2025. You will also be able to check the amounts transferred from your SA to your RA and/or OA from your CPF statement.

Hence, the age eligibility is capped at 70 years old in the assessment year.   Moreover, seniors above 70 years old would have already started receiving their payouts.

The monthly repayment amount may also be increased when the deferment period has ended so as to enable you to fully repay the outstanding loan within the remaining repayment period. As interest on the outstanding loan amount will continue to accrue during the deferment period, you are encouraged to start repayment as soon as you have the ability to do so. You can approach us to end the deferment earlier and to start repayment any time."

These new measures include:   Daily Withdrawal Limit    A limit that all CPF members aged 55 and above can set to determine the maximum daily amount they want to withdraw online. The amount withdrawable by CPF members aged 55 and above remains subjected to the current withdrawal rules.   All CPF members aged 55 and above will have their online Daily Withdrawal Limit defaulted at $2,000 for a start. Members who prefer a different Daily Withdrawal Limit can adjust it up to a maximum of $200,000, at any time under Account settings . Any increase to the Daily Withdrawal Limit will be subject to enhanced authentication measures and a 12-hour cooling period to provide sufficient time for members to react in the event of unauthorised adjustments.    CPF Withdrawal Lock   CPF members who wish to disable online withdrawals or do not plan to withdraw soon can consider activating the CPF Withdrawal Lock, which instantly sets the Daily Withdrawal Limit to $0. Please refer to the  three simple steps to activate the CPF Withdrawal Lock.   To re-enable online withdrawals, members would need to increase the online Daily Withdrawal Limit under Account settings . This requires enhanced authentication and 12 hours to take effect. Online CPF withdrawals can be made after 12 hours from the time members re-adjust their Daily Withdrawal Limit upwards.   Alternatively, members can also make an appointment to withdraw in person at CPF Service Centres if they do not want to adjust their online limit. Generally, the next available appointment would be in a week’s time; subsequently, members will receive their withdrawn CPF savings in their bank account registered with us generally within five working days. To minimise any potential delay during the withdrawal process, we encourage members intending to make large withdrawals to plan in advance.   Please visit the FAQs below to find out more on the Daily Withdrawal Limit and the CPF Withdrawal Lock:   What type of CPF withdrawals does the Daily Withdrawal Limit apply to and how do I change the Daily Withdrawal Limit?

Why does CPF Board not start my payouts automatically at 65?,why-does-cpf-board-not-start-my-payouts-automatically-at-65,"We understand that every member has unique retirement goals and needs. That is why we do not assume that everyone wants to start their payouts at 65.   Your CPF savings earn risk-free interest rates* of up to 6% per annum , which means the longer you wait to start your payouts, the more your retirement savings will grow. This increase in savings will result in higher monthly payouts under CPF LIFE.   Starting payouts automatically at 65 means denying members this option.   That is why we always encourage our members to instruct us when they want to start their payouts, as they would be the best judge of their own circumstances.   Here's an interesting fact: For every year that you defer your CPF LIFE payouts, your monthly payout amount increases by up to 7%. This means that if you defer for 5 years, your monthly payout could increase by up to 35%. Hence, weigh your options and make the decision that is best for you and your retirement goals.   * Based on the current 4% interest rate floor on Special and Retirement Account monies."

This is because no additional charge can be created on your property. If you need more information, you can approach the Official Assignee.   It is important to note that the amount of RA savings you can withdraw excludes interest earned, any government grants received and top-ups to your retirement savings . It also depends on your RA balance at the point of withdrawal. For example, if you are on CPF LIFE and have started your monthly payouts, any new inflows received in your RA will be used to increase your CPF LIFE premium to provide you with higher monthly payouts, and you will not be allowed to withdraw them in a lump sum.   * Excluding interest, any government grants and top-ups made under the Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme."

Ordinary Account (OA); and/or RA for members 55 or above and have not met their Full Retirement Sum (FRS) in their RA. MediSave Account (MA) Eligibility for tax relief You can enjoy tax relief if you made cash top-ups to yourself or your loved ones up to the current FRS . However, please note that tax relief would not apply if you made a CPF transfer. You will not be eligible for tax relief. For non self-employed persons: You get to enjoy tax relief for voluntary top-ups to MA.  If you are self-employed, you will enjoy  tax relief  on your  MediSave contributions   based on your annual net trade income (NTI). There will be no tax relief for your MediSave contributions if your assessed NTI for the year of assessment is zero or negative.   Top-up limit What is the maximum amount of top-ups I can receive? If you are below 55, you may top up your SA up to the current FRS. If you are 55 or above, you may top up your RA up to the current Enhanced Retirement Sum. You can check your top-up limit in your Retirement Dashboard . Can I voluntarily refund a portion of the CPF savings I used for my property? You can make a refund of any amount, capped at the full principal amount you have withdrawn for the property, along with the accrued interest. You may check the amount that you can refund through the Home Ownership Dashboard . Do note that after making a full voluntary housing refund of the CPF savings withdrawn and accrued interest, all CPF withdrawals including monthly housing loan instalments (if any) for the property will stop. What is the voluntary top-up limit to my MediSave Account? The maximum amount you can voluntarily top up to your MA is the difference between your Basic Healthcare Sum (BHS) and your current MA balance. Once your BHS has been reached, no further voluntary top-ups can be made to your MA. If you exceed your BHS from the top-up, the full amount of your top-up will be refunded to you. You can check your top-up limit with these steps. Withdrawal Top-ups are meant to boost your retirement income. They will be streamed out to you as monthly payouts and cannot be used for other purposes. You can continue to use your OA savings for the current or next property after making a voluntary housing refund. However, if you would like to use your OA for the same property, after making a voluntary refund of the full principal amount used and the accrued interest, you will need to re-apply to use your CPF savings. After turning 55 and setting aside the FRS, you can withdraw the remaining balance in your OA and SA in full or in part at any time. From 55, you can make retirement withdrawals from your OA and SA in full or in part, at any time for your immediate needs, provided you have set aside your FRS. MA savings are meant for your healthcare needs and cannot be withdrawn as cash. Application Top-ups can be made using cash and/or CPF transfers. How do I apply to make a top-up?

This is to simplify the process in making voluntary top-ups, regardless of whether you are earning income as a self-employed person.

He would receive less CPF that an employee who has regular monthly salary of $6,000 per month (same total income of $12,000 for January and February).   The annual earnings ceiling of $102,000 will apply to platform workers, on a per platform basis. Platform operators should not contribute any CPF contributions to their platform workers for any net earnings in excess of $102,000."
